#CAMPUS PLACEMENT PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict student placement outcomes based on various academic features. The aim is to assist students and academic institutions in understanding factors that influence placement success and make data-driven decisions to improve career guidance and support.
Model training and evaluation using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for robust evaluation.
